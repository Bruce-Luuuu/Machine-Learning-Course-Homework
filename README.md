# Machine-Learning-Course-Homework
About 20 days elapsedï¼ŒI finally finished this  Machine-Learning course which is taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera.  Before this, I have just heard about how popular ML is and never had a chance to learn something about it. So this course can be counted as my introduction to machine learning. 

Since some really complex part in the code are already finished, I think the coding of this course is not very hard. Over the course of finishing it, I try to write my code in a clean and efficient way.  I do hope my code can not only document my learning process, but also serve as a reference to help others.
